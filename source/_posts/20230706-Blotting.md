### Defination

Blotting techniques are used to detect and analyze three types of biological macromolecules: **`DNA`**, **`RNA`** and **`proteins`**. Results of a blotting experiment tell you whether a macromolecule of a specific sequence is present in your sample or not. And, if it indeed is present, its abundance in the sample can also be quantified$^{1}$.

- **`Western Blotting`**: Protein
- **`Southern Blotting`**: DNA
- **`Northern Blotting`**: RNA
